# React Unity Development Sample

This repo is intended for manually testing ReactUnity. If you are looking for a sample project, see https://github.com/ReactUnity/samples instead.

## How to Use

Open the project in Unity (2020.3 LTS). Open MainScene and click Play. UI should be rendered correctly.

To make changes to the UI:

- Go to `<ProjectRoot>/react`
- Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` from this folder
- Make changes to `src/showcase.tsx`
- Click "Play" in Unity. The changes you make to the source code will be automatically applied to the UI.

See the [main project](https://github.com/ReactUnity/core) for detailed instructions.
