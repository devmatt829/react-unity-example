# How to Use

Open the project in Unity. Open MainScene and click Play. You will see that UI is rendered correctly.

Go to `<ProjectRoot>/react` and change `index.ts`. Run `npm install` and then `npm run watch` from this folder. Now your changes will be automatically applied.

See the [main project](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/react-unity) for further details.
