# How to Use

Open the project in Unity (2020.2 +). Open MainScene and click Play. UI should be rendered correctly.

To make changes to the UI:

- Go to `<ProjectRoot>/react`
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` from this folder
- Make changes to `index.ts`
- Click "Play" in Unity. The changes you make to `index.ts` will be automatically applied to the UI.

See the [main project](https://github.com/ReactUnity/core) for further details.
